                  Thom Brodeur, a visionary entrepreneur and founder of Brodeur Beauty
                  and PageantFans™, is taking on the challenge of transforming the
                  global beauty pageant industry—a space historically centered on
                  women but often controlled by men. With a career spanning leadership
                  roles at tech and media giants like GoDaddy, Marketwired, and
                  Yandy.com, Brodeur has brought his unique business insights to
                  industries ranging from B2B to consumer-facing sectors. Today, he’s
                  channeling that experience into a bold initiative: reshaping the
                  pageant world to empower the women who fuel it.

                  Brodeur’s final word to our editor was “there is an old saying:
                  ‘behind every great man, there has to be a great woman.’ Personally?
                  I’d like to flip that on its head. I want to be the great man,
                  behind every great woman who chooses to participate in this
                  industry. Going back to basics, remembering what and most
                  importantly ‘who’ is the center of these industries, and innovating
                  and challenging the status quo is how we’ll get there. Watch this
                  space for big things. They’re coming.”
